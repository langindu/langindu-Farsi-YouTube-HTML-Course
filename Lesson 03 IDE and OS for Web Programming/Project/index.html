    <h1>IDEs and OSs for web Programming</h1>
    <p>IDE is an acronym for "Integrated Development Environment.â€œ</p>

        <p>A good IDE helps you write, correct, arrange, and run your codes in a safe and controllable environment.</p>
        <p>There are three types of IDE: stand-alone (installer or portable), Online (Free or paid), and network (Cloud or inner network).</p>
        <p>
        We use stand-alone and free IDE for this course.
